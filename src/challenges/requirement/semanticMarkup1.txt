/* CHALLENGE 1: SEMANTIC MARKUP

This will eventually be a section of a larger page, showing each robot with their name. We will use Flexbox to control their arrangement.

Your task is to semantically mark up what you see here. 

- DO NOT WORRY about what it looks like! It will look terrible.

- WORRY about whether you are conveying the right meaning in your HTML.

  * I've given you the markup for the image.
  * What is the relationship between the image and the name underneath? How should you convey that relationship?
  * What is the relationship of each image-name pair to each other? What is this in terms of content?
