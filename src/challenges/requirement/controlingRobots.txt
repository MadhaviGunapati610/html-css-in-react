/*
CHALLENGE 4: CONTROLLING ROBOTS AND BREAKPOINTS

Time for our final tidy-up for this section of the website!

Currently, the robots flow from one line to another, but they do not change size.

See if you can control the robots in the following way:

>850px -- 3 robots per row

550-850px -- 2 robots per row

<550px -- 1 robot per row

DO NOT CHANGE THE HTML - you should be able to do this in just a few lines of CSS!

Adjust the font size for the robot's name if that's helpful.
