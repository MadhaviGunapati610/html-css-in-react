/* CHALLENGE 6: TWO WAYS TO LAY OUT A HEADER 

I've given you the same HTML twice, once with a header ID of method1, and the other of method2.

Create two possible layouts of this header:

#method1: Center the image on its own line. Underneath, create a horizontal nav bar going all the way across the full page.

#method2: Place the image on the left and the navbar on the right. Display links as individual pills.

#method3: A variation of #method2 - display the bar as a continuous unit.

BONUS: Do not change the HTML! You should be able to create both of these headers with the HTML you have, using some standard CSS selectors.

For a font, use Roboto Slab, available at Google Fonts. You'll need to incorporate this in CodePen via the Settings - CSS - External files setting at the top right of the screen.

Color palette includes:
#00BFF3  blue
#FF715B  red
#F0C808  yellow
#4C5B5C  dark gray
