/* CHALLENGE 5: MARKING UP A NAVIGATION BAR AND HEADER 

Given the starting SVG image and navigation items, using semantic HTML, mark this up as if this were the header of a website. 

Use a placeholder for the target of the link. The links don't need to go anywhere.

HINT: Remember it does not matter what direction the navigation will display to mark it up semantically. HTML is about identifying content, not about how that content looks!
